  # The `volumes` tag allows us to share a folder with our container.
  # Its syntax is as follows: [folder path on our machine]:[folder path to retrieve in the container]
  # volumes:
  # In this example, we share the folder `db-data` in our root repository, with the default PostgreSQL data path.
  # It means that every time the repository is modifying the data inside
  # of `/var/lib/postgresql/data/`, automatically the change will appear in `db-data`.
  # You don't need to create the `db-data` folder. Docker Compose will do it for you.
  #  - ./db/data/:/var/lib/postgresql/data/
